ADAPTER PATTERN
===============

Let's suppose, your teacher had given some assignment.
For that you need a pen, but unfortunately you don't have it.
So, you took it from one of yours friend and he gave a Pilot Pen without ink.

To use this pen, you've used a refill(as AdapterForUsingPen class) and then finished your assignment.

To summarize:

- [AssignmentWork class] =>  for writing an assignment
- [AdapterForUsingPen class] => to refill the PilotPen
- [PenInterface interface] => showing specs of pen

- helperPackage
  A friend with PilotPen class
